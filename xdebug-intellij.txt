I am developing a big web application in PHP, and recently switch to
IntelliJ. IntelliJ offers the possibility to do remote debugging with
XDebug, which was pretty easy to set up. Starting a request with
?XDEBUG_SESSION_START=intellij appended to the url starts off a remote
connection from PHP to the listening IntelliJ debugger.

However, I am using a dispatcher pattern in PHP to route single
requests to different OO-handlers, REST handlers as well as static
handlers that serve the Javascript, CSS and images. Each of these
requests would trigger a back connection to IntelliJ, which slowed
down everything and proved to be pretty annoying. I want to remove
certain areas of the website from the Xdebug remote debugging. This
wasn't so easy, as there is no "exclude" option either in the XDebug
toggler plugins or XDebug itself.

Xdebug looks for a cookie called XDEBUG_SESSION, which is used to
initiate the back connection. The value is the idekey which is used to
differentiate between different listening debuggers. I wasn't able to
go around this by setting it to an empty value for the resources I
wanted to exclude. However, using a non-sense key seemed to work. I
thus added the following code to my application:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/1600897.js?file=dispatch"></script>
